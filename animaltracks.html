Several features contained within an animal footprint can be used to aid in the identification of an animal. Amongst these features, the most common and most used by humans to manually identify the animal is the number and size of blobs in the footprint.

            <h3><p style="text-align:center">Relative Sizes Across Families</p></h3>
            <h5><p style="text-align:center">The tracks that animals leave are not only indications of what
                species they are but also clues as to their life history, habitats,
                and movements. Wild animals are generally wary of humans,
                and much of their activity remains undetected by our eyes. But
                even if they themselves are not seen, they leave a record of their
                existence by their tracks. This book is designed to serve as an
                introduction to recognizing and appreciating the hundreds of different
                kinds of tracks that we can find in the United States, and
                includes those of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. With
                keen observence, not only will you be better able to determine
                which animal made a certain track, but you will also allow yourself
                to become closer to their world, their habits, and their secrets. I
                list here some of the more common animal tracks you are likely to
                encounter in the United States. There are, of course, many others
                that are not included, but most will be similar to the individual
                species or animal families listed here, and will give you a starting
                point to refining your searches and your understanding of the
                wild world, from mountaintops to seashores to desert plains.</p></h5>

            <h3><p style="text-align:center">Footprint Features : Parts of a Track</p></h3>
            <h5><p style="text-align:center">When you come across a clear track in mud, sand or soft soil one of the most useful things to do is to count the number of toes and claws. This information alone is often enough to place the track in a given family. Then, by analyzing the track’s shape and size, you can usually identify the species. When a track is made, the heel slides into the ground, registers and pulls out. No track will register straight
                down. There is always some angled component (looking at the track cross-section) either from the foot entering
                or the foot leaving.
                The softer the soil, the greater the slope of the wall creating a larger distortion between the overall track and the
                true track. Most people don’t read the true track. They read the horizon cuts (overall track) which does not give
                the true track measurement. The true track is the only real measurement for tracking. If you read the overall
                track you could not tell the difference between a dog track and a coyote track. E.g. on a dog the inner toes are
                larger than the outer toes; on a coyote the outer toes are larger. But this distinction will not show on the overall
                track.</p></h5>
