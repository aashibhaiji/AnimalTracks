            <h2><p>Step 1 : Picking a Topic</p></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>I wanted to pick a scientific visualisation, creating something that was informative. Bringing hidden knowledge to mainstream audiences and presenting it in a away that is engaging and changes their view-point towards the topic. Situation and Problem. Purpose and Value. Audience. Usage Context. Medium of Output.</p>
            <br/>

            <h2><p>Step 2 : Gathering Domain Knowledge</p></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>I started reading more on animal footprints and mapping the various avenues in which I could use for comparison and study. Data Requirement. Descriptive and Exploratory.  </p>
            <br/>

            <h2><p>Step 3 : Insight Exploration </p></h2>
            <hr>
            <p> I was asking questions to figure out the relationships and patterns in the data and gather insights. Building Understanding, getting new questions, testing models</p>
            <br/>

            <h2><p>Step 4 : Data Collection </p></h2>
            <hr>
            <p> I created an excel sheet on which I collected data about 45 animals and various features</p>
            <br/>

            <h2><p>Step 5 : Forming the Narrative and Insight Exploration </p></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>I wanted to make an informative storytelling piece and worked on the story structure. Worked on deciding layouts, visual representation of the story, messaging and emphasis, overview and details on demand. Data Story. Asking few simple questions.  </p>
            <br/>

            <h2><p>Step 6 : Sketching </p></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The best way to explore how to represent the story and add multiple layers to it was through sketching. I tried to revel the story in parts with building knowledge with each representation as you scroll down. I wanted it to add to the readers knowledge to make it more effective.</p>
            <br/>

            <h2><p>Step 7 : Play! </p></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>I started making the visuals on illustrator. Colour Palette. Typography. Layouts. </p>
